# First-timer with a commercial machine

## Introduction

So, you've had espresso before, and you want more.  Conveniently, someone has left you alone with this HULK of a machine in front of you.  Let's make some espresso!

First time around, we'll aim low. A little bit of black fluid dripping into a cup will be a good start.


## What you should have in front of you

* Coffee, whole beans in a grinder
* Commercial grade coffee grinder
* Commercial grade espresso machine
* Tamper
* Portafilter
* Portafilter basket
* Knockbox
* Cloths or paper towels
* AN OVERWHELMING NEED FOR ESPRESSO

## Before you do anything

Any place that is metal may be hot. Touch the espresso machine gingerly until you know.

The portafilter and its basket should be warm.  Normally, this is done by keeping it attached to the machine.  If it is not attached, look on top where cups are normally kept or ???.

Now that you have something to put coffee in, let's figure out how the machine works.

Many machines have a faucet, which is for dispensing VERY hot water, and a longer metal or white plastic tube which is used for dispensing steam.  Those usually have levers or knobs nearby. Point the steam wand away from you and try it out.  It's fun!

Look near the place where the portafilter fits (aka the grouphead) for controls there.  You may see a big lever, a small lever, a paddle-y looking thing, or a handful of buttons:

* A big lever: Is it the size of your forearm? Does it take some strength to pull it down?  You've got yourself a lever machine.  Read this guide, but don't follow it until you read the notes about the lever at the end.  Also, never put your head over it.  You'll need new teeth.
* Paddle on the group:  Pushing it all the way opposite of where it is at will likely engage it as far as is needed.  If there is a gauge or other markers, you'll be shooting for "9 bars" when we get to making the coffee.
* Little lever: Lift it up and water should come out.  Push it down and the water stops.
* Buttons: Press 'em.  What happens?  These are usually programmable, but who knows what the person who owns this programmed them to be?  Instead of figuring that out now, look for a stack of two little cups or something else that might indicate a double espresso.  Alternatively, see if pressing a button, then pressing it again turns the water on and off.  That'll be enough for the first go.

Alright, now you know enough to burn yourself, and maybe even soothe yourself with a coffee afterwards.

(Look around [Espresso in Pictures](images/) if you'd like some visual guidance until it is added inline.)

## Warm up

If you can, put some hot water from the machine's tap in your espresso cup.  If this machine sees lots of random use, run some water through the group to clean off godknowswhat.

Get the portafilter and basket, and wipe out any moisture inside.

If the basket and portafilter are very shallow, it may be for pods! Don't cram coffee in it.  Look for a pod, place it in the holder, lock it in, and press a button.  Then stop reading unless there is a deeper basket around.

## Grind.

You're going to need to figure out how to turn it on.  I'll give you a few hints, though. Check the bottom-right for a knob or button.  Twist/push, but be ready to twist/push back since it'll grind fast.  If that doesn't work, look on the top of any sort of "cone" for buttons.  Maybe a little cup emblem or two?

If the grinder has a cone with a hole in the bottom, or a chute, then it will spit out grounds right into the portafilter.  If not has a cylinder with a flappy paddle on the side, it will fill that chamber.  Then when you pull the paddle towards you, it will move the grinds towards a hole in the front.  Flap, flap, flap .. COFFEE.

We'll save the nitty gritty for [Espresso by Numbers](numbers.md).  We'll put in the coffee grounds by volume. It isn't particularly accurate, but it'll get you going.

* Put the portafilter under the dispensing hole of the grinder.
* Turn on the grinder
* Turn off the grinder
* Flap the paddle if needed
* How'd you do?

You'll want a heap of coffee in the basket exceeding the height.

## Puck prep

Now let's even it out a little.  Take your index finger and slide it from the bottom (closest to your body) to the top until you're about to fling coffee everywhere.  Then reverse direction bringing the heap to the bottom.  Then push whatever is left of it back to the middle.  Now do the same from left to right and back again.  If there is any left, sweep it off the top into a nearby sink or knockbox.

Now grab the tamper and hold the portafilter level on a flat surface or against the side of the counter.  Take the tamper and push down evenly on the coffee grounds.  The most important thing is to be level.  The amount of force can vary. Don't hurt yourself.  Just try to make it level and don't push too hard.  Just try to remember what you do so you can do it again later.


## Lock'n'load

The portafilter has those weird pieces that stick off, just like our heads.
Those ears lock into the grouphead by fitting into slots and then twisting in
against a rubber gasket for a pressure fit.  Lock it in.  Don't hurt yourself,
but make sure it's tight.  Otherwise hot water will leak out.

Put your cup under the spout(s).

Start the water -- however you figured out how to do it earlier.

If it didn't seem to stop itself, then be ready to stop it after 25-30s.  It's a good starting point.

## Watch and learn

If all goes well, after about 4 seconds you'll start to see a thin stream of espresso come out of the spouts.  If you're using a double-spouted portafilter, expect to see two thin streams that are dark brown.  Often they are called "mouse tails".  As the shot progresses, they will change color.

If you did it perfectly on the first go, they will be smooth and towards the end, get a little wiggle.  When it wiggles turn off the water or pull out the cup.

If not, watch for the color to get too light or, if you can tell, for the surface tension to change and look more watery.  Those are good signs you're done.


If it isn't going that well, then there are two main ways it could be going horribly wrong:

* OMG GUSHING
* Where is my espresso?

If the liquid is just gushing out, you can make adjustments.  If we assume this
is not your gear, you can only adjust yourself. Try repeating everything above,
but tamp a little harder.  If that doesn't work, then after you're done
grinding, lightly tap the bottom of the portafilter a couple of times.  Did the
cone-of-grinds collapse?  Can you fit more in? If yes, add some, then continuie
from there.  If none of those help, then either you grabbed a crazy basket or
the grind is way off (or worse).  Time to get some help.

If the espresso is no where to be found, just dripping out. Stop everything,
clean it up, and try again.  On the next time, try tamping much, much softer
and see what happens.  If that doesn't help, try using less coffee. If the
grinder has a circular lid ont he dosing chamber, you may be able to use it to
scoop a smooth curve out of the top of the grounds before tamping.  Try it.  If
all else fails, talk to someone who knows.  The grind, machine, or you may need
better calibration!


## Dirty things taste dirty

If you leave the machine dirty, it will make espresso that tasty dirty.
There are some very basic steps you can take to limit dirtiness without
knowing how to clean a machine well:

* Knocking out the puck, or how to get rid of all that used coffee

When the shot is done, the coffee grounds in the basket will need to be
dumped somewhere.  Often, there is a box with a bar you can whack it on.
This is called a knock box, and you can knock the portafilter on it to
get out the spent coffee.  If all is well, it may look like an ice
hockey puck when it comes out.

If there is no knockbox, the trash or a sink will do.

* Purging and rinsing

Purging is when you press the button/lift the lever/... that less water
come out where the portafilter normally sits.  This will flush off old
coffee from the dispersion screen, the place where the water is
dispersed onto the coffee.  Do this for a few seconds.  You can even
rinse the portafilter and basket under here to get off left over
grounds.

* Wiping

If there are paper towels around (or dedicated espresso towels!), then
after the knock and rinsing, wipe off the dispersion screen and wipe out
the basket.  You can stop here in most cases.

* Wiggling

Wiggling is a trick that can be used while purging and rinsing.  Once
the basket is rinsed out, hold it as if you were going to lock in the
portafilter until HOT water coming out of the portafilter and may be
streaming over the sides.  Then loosely lock and unlock the portafilter.
Water should be forced up and over the sides over and over again.  This
'wiggle' helps rinse any coffee grounds off of the seals that the
portafilter locks against.  You can usually do a purge and rinse and
wiggle very quickly, and be ready to move on.

* Scrubbing

Scrubbing the dispersion screen, gasket, basket, and portafilter can all
be saved for a more detailed discussion of machine maintenance.


## Steam!

This section is not yet written.  There are many aids online to help
learn to steam milk until then! Just remember, always turn the steam
wand on for a little bit to blow out condensed water in the pipes and
ensure there is no vacuum.  Then turn it off, plunge it into the milk,
and turn it back on.

When you're done, ALWAYS wipe it off with a wet cloth and turn the wand
on to let it blow out any milk in the pipe until it looks clean.  If
not, things will get gross really, really fast.


## Big ol' lever

Spring lever machines work similarly to above, but they often lack
buttons in lieu of a large lever you pull on.  Pulling the lever some
should release some water from the grouphead (where the portafilter
fits).  Pulling it all the way down is the same as pressing the button
on an electronically controlled (e.g., a semi-auto) machine or flipping
the small lever on certain machines (Google a "E61 Brew Group").  At the
bottom of the stroke, water is in contact with coffee, but it is only
under nominal pressure.  Pushing the lever back up should engage the
spring which will apply the required pressure to the water to force it
through the coffee.

Be VERY careful with big levers.  They can and will break faces if a
face is nearby.  Never put your head over one when pulling it down or
releasing it.

(This section could be much more detailed.  That can wait for another
day.)
